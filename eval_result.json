      "must_use_tools": [],
      "answer": "To add caching for repeated web search queries, I would implement the following system:\n\n1.  **Cache Store:** I would use a key-value store like Redis or Memcached. The search query would serve as the key, and the search results would be the value.\n\n2.  **Request Workflow:**\n    *   When a user submits a search query, I would first generate a unique key from the query string (e.g., by hashing it).\n    *   I would then check if this key exists in the cache.\n    *   **Cache Hit:** If the key exists, I would retrieve the search results from the cache and return them to the user immediately. This avoids the need to perform a new web search, reducing latency.\n    *   **Cache Miss:** If the key does not exist, I would proceed with the normal process of performing the web search. Once the search results are retrieved, I would store them in the cache using the generated key before returning them to the user.\n\n3.  **Time-To-Live (TTL):** To ensure the freshness of the search results, I would associate a Time-To-Live (TTL) with each cached entry. The TTL would be a duration (e.g., 1 hour) after which the cached entry is automatically evicted from the cache. This is crucial because web search results can change frequently, and a TTL ensures that users eventually get fresh data. The choice of TTL would be a trade-off between performance and data freshness.",

      "must_use_tools": [],
      "answer": "Here are two UI patterns for showing tool call traces in a chat interface:\n\n### 1. The \"Expandable\" Trace\n\nThis pattern displays a concise summary of the tool call directly in the chat, with the ability for the user to click to see more details. This keeps the main chat flow clean and readable, while still providing transparency for users who want to inspect the underlying processes.\n\n*   **Default View:** A single line or a small card that says something like \"Searching with DuckDuckGo for 'UI patterns'\" or \"Used the math tool\". This can also include a small icon or a \"badge\" to indicate that a tool was used.\n*   **Expanded View:** When the user clicks on the summary, it expands to show the full tool call details, including the parameters, the response, and any other relevant information. This detailed view can be presented in a structured format like a code block or a formatted table.\n\n**Use Cases:** This pattern is ideal for most general-purpose chat applications where the primary focus is on the conversation, but transparency about tool usage is still important. It's a good default choice for keeping the interface uncluttered.\n\n### 2. The \"Timeline\" View\n\nThis pattern presents the sequence of tool calls in a visual timeline, running parallel to the main chat conversation. This is particularly useful for complex tasks that involve multiple tool calls, as it provides a clear and scannable overview of the entire process.\n\n*   **Visualization:** The timeline can be displayed to the side of the chat or as a collapsible panel. Each step in the timeline would represent a tool call, showing the tool used and a brief summary of the action taken.\n*   **Interaction:** Users can click on each step in the timeline to see the full details of that specific tool call. This allows users to trace the agent's \"thinking\" process from start to finish.\n\n**Use Cases:** This pattern is best suited for agent-like interfaces where the AI is performing complex, multi-step tasks. It's excellent for debugging and for users who need to understand the sequence of operations, such as developers or analysts. This more advanced view helps to create a \"sandbox\" environment for users to test and understand the agent's capabilities.",

If a system chooses C over A, it will return an error or time out if it cannot guarantee that the data is the most recent.
